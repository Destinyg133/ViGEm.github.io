## Mirrors & Archives

You can explore mirror copies or archived binaries [on the file server](https://downloads.vigem.org/), these are typically in "working conditions" but may no longer be maintained or have been superseded by other solutions. Use with care ‚ú®

## Buildbot Archive

Copies of build artifacts spit out by [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) are mirrored [on a separate file server](https://buildbot.vigem.org/) since they get removed automatically from their infrastructure after 6 months. Drivers hosted there are unsigned (or test-signed) and therefore won't work on a non-developer-machine with the right preparations. Build artifacts are of interest typically only to developers or beta-testing folks, explore at your own risk ü¶ã
