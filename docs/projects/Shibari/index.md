Shibari was an intermediate test platform for gaming input peripherals written in C#. It acted as a remapping middleware between ViGEmBus for outputs and some emerging driver projects of the past (FireShock, AirBender, BthPS3) relaying input reports and vibration commands between devices. It briefly served as a mini-replacement for ScpToolkit while the arising driver components were still in a research and early development phase. C# was chosen as it allowed for rapid prototyping.

It was in development from October 2017 to February 2021 until it got archived in favour of better solutions. Its direct successors are BthPS3 and DsHidMini.
