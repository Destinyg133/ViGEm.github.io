## x360ce

"Xbox 360 Controller Emulator" allows your controller (gamepad, joystick, wheel, etc.) to function as an Xbox 360 controller. For example, it lets you play games such as "Grand Theft Auto" (GTA) or "Mafia II" using a Logitech Wheel.

## XOutput

If you have an older or not supported game controller (gamepad, wheel, joystick, etc.), but XBox 360 controllers are supported you can use this software and enjoy gaming with your controller.

XOutput is a software that can convert DirectInput into XInput. DirectInput data is read and sent to a virtual XInput (Xbox 360 Controller) device. XInput is the new standard game controller input on windows, and DirectInput can no longer be used with Universal Windows Platform software, but with this tool you can use DirectInput devices as well.

## HIDer

HIDer is an open source application that allows you to manage HidGuardian in order to hide chosen controllers from being seen by games/applications (that are not whitelisted). This is useful when some games/applications have issues with specific controllers that are connected.

## JoyShockMapper

The Sony PlayStation DualSense, DualShock 4, Nintendo Switch JoyCons (used in pairs), and Nintendo Switch Pro Controller have much in common. They have many of the features expected of modern game controllers. They also have an incredibly versatile and underutilised input that their biggest rival (Microsoft's Xbox One controller) doesn't have: a 3-axis gyroscope (from here on, ‚Äúgyro‚Äù).

My goal with JoyShockMapper is to enable you to play PC games with DS, DS4, JoyCons, and Pro Controllers even better than you can on their respective consoles -- and demonstrate that more games should use these features in these ways.
