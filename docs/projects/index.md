# About Projects

Welcome! 👋

Here you can find an overview over past and actively maintained projects under the wings of the ViGEm "ecosystem" 😁

Most of them - if they're open-source - you'll find on GitHub primarily; these sites here are meant to provide extended user documentation (less developer-heavy), a bit of history insights for discontinued projects and announcements or in-progress information for solutions currently cooking in the labs 😎
