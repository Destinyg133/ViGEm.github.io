# About HidHide

HidHide is an "input device firewall" inspired by HidGuardian but designed and written from scratch. It allows for blocking individual applications access to HID and XInput devices, allowing users to re-route and re-map controller inputs as they please.

!!! attention "Not yet release-ready"
    The project is currently developed and tested in private and is aimed to be released towards the end of 2020. Watch this page for updates 😁
