# Roadmap

Rough road map with useful features (in no particular order):

- [ ] Finish and package the driver configuration UI tool
- [ ] Implement the unfinished sections in the channel connection completion routines causing memory leaks on unexpected connection failure (search for TODO:)
- [ ] Switch Setup framework from Advanced Installer to WiX
- [ ] Change filter driver installation from service to classic PNP system startup driver
