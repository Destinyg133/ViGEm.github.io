# Getting a kernel driver to talk

Kernel Drivers typically don't write traditional log files that end up on the disk somewhere, instead [Event Tracing for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/event-tracing-for-windows) is used to write messages to a special logging facility we can tap into with a bit of command line magic.

## Capture the trace

### Start trace session

Fire up PowerShell with administrative privileges by pressing ++win+x++ and selecting it from the appearing menu like so:

![Start PowerShell](/images/Y2bzZWdYK4.png)

Once open, paste the following three lines into it "as is" and hit enter:

!!! example "PowerShell"
    ```PowerShell
    New-EtwTraceSession -Name BthPS3 -LogFileMode 0x8100 -FlushTimer 1 -LocalFilePath "C:\BthPS3.etl"
    Add-EtwTraceProvider -SessionName BthPS3 -Guid ‚Äò{37dcd579-e844-4c80-9c8b-a10850b6fac6}‚Äô -MatchAnyKeyword 0x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF -Level 0xFF -Property 0x40
    Add-EtwTraceProvider -SessionName BthPS3 -Guid ‚Äò{586aa8b1-53a6-404f-9b3e-14483e514a2c}‚Äô -MatchAnyKeyword 0x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF -Level 0xFF -Property 0x40
    ```

Should looks similar to this:

### Perform the action you want captured

Now is the time to attempt pairing a controller or whatever logic you wish to test and get captured in the trace log file.

### Stop trace session

Once everything we like to know has been captured, stop the session so the data collection stops and the log file is closed:

!!! example "PowerShell"
    ```PowerShell
    Remove-EtwTraceSession -Name BthPS3
    ```

The log file should now exist under the C:\\-Drive:

![Folder](/images/AnyDesk_LVe8LzooAQ.png)

## Great, I got it, what now

So we've captured the `BthPS3.etl` file, but what now? Well, the easy way is to submit it to Nefarius for analysis üòÅ Or, you can take a peek at its contents for yourself if you read on.

## Decipher the trace file content

The trace files are not readable with a traditional text editor, some special tools are required to get the spicy bits out of it. Microsoft provides tools for the task but they are awfully verbose and not easy on the beginner in the authors humble opinion, so use of a 3rd party tool is highly recommended.
