# FireShock Removal Guide

Download, extract and run [Driver Store Explorer](https://github.com/lostindark/DriverStoreExplorer/releases/latest) and look for the FireShock driver there, tick it, tick the `Force Deletion` box and finally hit the `Delete Driver(s)` button.

After that, simply unplug and plugin your controller(s) or reboot the machine and let Windows download the manufacturer drivers. Done! ðŸŽ‰
