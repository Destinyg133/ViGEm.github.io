    - [X] Add USB and Bluetooth Hardware IDs to INF
    - [ ] Adapt feature report for setting/getting Bluetooth master address
    - [ ] Implement device-specific low battery indicator (LED rapid flashing?)
- [ ] Implement auto-disconnect on wireless after idle timeout to save battery ‚ö°
- [ ] Implement/expose more options to control pairing behavior ‚¨áÔ∏è
- [ ] UI tool for configuration file ‚¨áÔ∏è
- [ ] UDP server for `cemuhook` compatibility ‚ùì
    - See [ds4drv](https://github.com/TheDrHax/ds4drv-cemuhook)
- [ ] Test/fix power behavior (like, what happens when the system wants to sleep with controllers connected etc.) ‚ö°
- [ ] Integrate ViGEm client SDK for XInput support ‚ö°
- [ ] Add remapping capabilities ‚¨áÔ∏è
    - See [jfes](https://github.com/dmitrii-eremin/jfes)

- [X] Implement/expose rumble support via PID/FFB ‚ö°
    - [X] Craft and test necessary PID section for report descriptor
    - [X] Add OEM registry values for DirectInput to detect effects
    - [X] Decode and implement output and feature reports
        - `Constant Force` effect is implemented
- [ ] Implement/expose gyro and accelerometer via some channel ‚ùì
- [ ] Bluetooth: replace current verbose code with `DMF_ContinuousRequestTarget` ‚¨áÔ∏è
